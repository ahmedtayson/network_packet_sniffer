Programming a network packet monitor such as Wireshark

It is the most famous program for monitoring the movement of packets and data across the network
 We will be able to know:

The device that sends and receives an IP packet

The MAC address of the device sending and receiving the packet

The packet will enter which port the packet exited from and from which port and you will know from which port

Either to the sender or to the recipient

You will also be able to print the data passed, the size of the packet, and locate the device to which the packet was sent or from which the packet was received
